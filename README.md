## ✏️ About

This project was developed on Stage 2 in the Explorer course at the [Rocketseat School](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). To access the entire course's assignments click on [this link](https://github.com/jeadamek/explorer-rocketseat).

In this challenge, it was requested to fix a landing page. The HTML file's semantics and structure were all messed up, and the goal was to fix it.

I could practice and study:

- HTML structure;
- HTML semantics;
- HTML accessibility;
